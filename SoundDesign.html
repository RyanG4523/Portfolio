<h3>SFX Narrative</h3>

  </audio>
   <p>The goal of this roject was to create a narrative that was only told through sound with little to no dialogue. For this project I decided to try to tell the story of a soldier in a battle finding an object magic in nature and is cursed by it. He was able to single handedly turn the tide of battle but is horrorified by what he has become.</p>

   <p>The goal of this roject was to find a song longer than 5 minutes and cut it to be about 2 minutes while making it seem like the song is meant to be that length.</p>
